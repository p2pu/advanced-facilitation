In collaboration with the Rhode Island Library Association (RILA), P2PU has developed this five-part course for individuals who want to go into more depth on facilitation beyond what is offered in [Learning about Learning Circles](https://p2pu.github.io/learning-about-learning-circles/). The course was designed such that each module could be run as an standalone 60-90 minute workshop or run consecutively as a five-part learning circle. The five modules are:
- <strong>[Co-facilitation](/advanced-facilitation/modules/co-facilitation/check-in/)</strong>: How to lead peer learning programs. with a partner.
- <strong>[Self-advocacy](/advanced-facilitation/modules/self-advocacy/check-in/)</strong>: How to look out for yourself when running a program.
- <strong>[Technical programs](/advanced-facilitation/modules/technical-programs/check-in/)</strong>: How to lead technical programs when youâ€™re a non-expert.
- <strong>[Difficult Discussions](/advanced-facilitation/modules/difficult-discussions/check-in/)</strong>: How to navigate sensitive and interpersonal topics.
- <strong>[Safe Spaces](/advanced-facilitation/modules/safe-spaces/check-in/)</strong>: How to balance feeling safe with feeling challenged.


#### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).
