## Scenario Breakouts (35 min)

Discuss two of the following scenarios and how you would handle the situation in light of the three key components  presented in the video. Feel free to point out any pitfalls you recognize in any of the scenarios.

15 min: First Breakout

Breakout Room #1
The debris pile in your neighbor’s yard has been lying alongside the driveway between your properties for months. You look at it when you leave for work, at night when you return, and when you mow your lawn on the weekend. At first you thought surely your neighbor would haul it to the landfill the next weekend. Now it’s been two months that the eyesore has been there.

Breakout Room #2
You have recently moved in with your partner/spouse/significant other and it's time to talk about budgeting. Your partner presents you with a proposed budget and suggests that you combine all your accounts. You’re concerned about this because you two have never discussed your financial habits before and you have a lot of student loan debt. You’re also pretty sure your partner makes less money than you.

5 min: Come back to the main room, re-breakout

15 min: Second Breakout

Breakout Room #1
There is an elderly man sleeping in the teen fiction room of the library. You, as well as other library staff, have already asked him to not sleep in the library on a number of occasions. 

Breakout Room #2
You hear yelling coming from the circulation desk; it sounds like one of the patrons is having a heated argument with the circulation staff about missing materials. You know both people—your colleague at the desk has worked at the library for many years and you are confident in their ability. You also know the patron as a regular library visitor who is very familiar with library operations.
