## Guardrails (20mins)

Another facet of this conversation is how the institutions that we are a part of can support us in being our best selves.  
In this snippet of an article called the librarians are not okay we would like you to read through the section titled [“On the team level: you need guardrails, and you need solidarity”](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-librarians-are-not-okay). (We highly recommend reading this article in its entirety later)

Take 5 minutes individually to read through this short snippet  and then let's discuss as a group about Guardrails: 

* What Guardrails do you have in place at your institution?
* Do you use these guardrails?
* Are there any other Guardrails that you would like at your institution to support you and your work?
