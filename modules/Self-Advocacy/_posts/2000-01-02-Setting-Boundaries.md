## Boundary Setting (25 mins)

In this activity we’re going to work on how to avoid burnout by identifying where we need to set healthy boundaries. In this activity there are four major strategies to help you identify your personal boundaries.
1. Identify your limits – Clarifying what your emotional, mental, physical, spiritual limits are. Do this by paying attention to yourself and noticing what you can tolerate and accept as well as what makes you feel uncomfortable and stressed. 
2. Pay attention to your feelings – Notice the three key feelings that are often cues that you need to set boundaries: 1) discomfort; 2) resentment; 3) guilt. If a particular situation, person, or area of your life is leading you to feel uncomfortable, resentful, or guilty, these are important cues that boundaries may need to be set or re-assessed. 
3. Give yourself permission to set boundaries – when you fear how a person will respond if you set or enforce boundaries, reaffirm to yourself that you do indeed have this right. 
4. Consider your environment – your environment can either support your setting boundaries or present obstacles to boundary setting.
