## Reflection (10 mins)

An important final component of co-facilitation is to follow up your experience with a debrief. Debriefing allows you and your co-facilitator to discuss what went well or what needs improvement so that you can actively refine your facilitation process. Below are a few debrief questions that you can use to reflect on todayâ€™s session and/or to guide a debrief with your future co-facilitators:



1. How is everyone feeling after today's session?
2. Do we have any highlights or concerns that we would like to share about this session?
3. What did each of us learn today?
4. What do you want to be acknowledged for today?
5. What is our plan for our next facilitated session?
