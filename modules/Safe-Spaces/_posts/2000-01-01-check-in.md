According to Merriam Webster The term safe space refers to places "intended to be free of bias, conflict, criticism, or potentially threatening actions, ideas, or conversations". In this module we will be exploring safe spaces, the intentions behind them and how to make them more dynamic so that the knowledge sharing in these spaces encourages us to learn and be thoughtful in and out of these spaces.  

Introduce yourself to the group and share your intention or goal for working with or participating in safe spaces.
