## Reflections

Having a Conversation in a safe or brave space can be challenging, but it can also be enlightening.  At the end of the session it is best practice to run a reflection. Here are a few sample question but this can take different forms:

*How is everyone feeling after todayâ€™s session? 
*Do we have any highlights or concerns that we would like to share about this session? 
*What did each of us learn today?
